# Pdfer
A basic C# library meant to make accessing and manipulating PDFs complicated but extremely powerfull.

## Usage
I can't be bothered to write a guide, just. Instantiate PdfDocumentFactory and go from there, or use the handy PdfDocumentFactory.Instance as the ctor will change soon.

## Why
I and someone I know want a library that allows us to easily manipulate PDFs on a object level, so I decided to parse PDFs.

## Help
No.

## I want to give help
Yes!
